#FridaysForFuture is a youth-led and coordinated campaign that started in 2018 summer. Greta Thunberg, and other young activists protested the lack of action on climate change in front of the Swedish parliament for weeks. This went viral on social media, and the campaign thus began. 

"What do we want?"
"Climate justice!"

A typical campaign would likely have had the above dialogue, as Greta and other activists rush joining activists to chant with them. Campaigns are in general written about on social media (twitter), and receive quite a lot of reaction. "#UPROOTTHESYSTEM"

The narrative of the campaign attempts to draw attention to the current complete lact of action towards the climate crisis by the biggest governments. The activists have a set of demands as per the ever growing need for change, each year. In 2019, the set of demands looked like this
The major causes of human climate change, according to the FFF, are the elder generations' unsustainable transportation systems, consumption habits, and lifestyles. Not to mention the rampant use of single use of plastics, consumerism, and food culturing. (Yes, cattle flatulence is pretty bad.)
> Keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels.
Ensure climate justice and equity.
Listen to the best united science currently available.

Fridays for Future has reinvigorated global debate on climate change at a critical time when the window of opportunity to avoid the worst effects of rising temperatures is closing. 
Global emissions are at all-time highs, with no signs of abating. 
Sea levels are rising throughout the world, coral reefs are vanishing, and extreme weather events are becoming more often and catastrophic.

These yearly marches have attracted over one million young people from over 100 countries. 
Thunberg states, "Everyone is welcome." "Everyone is required."

The national government would have to face the existing climate situation as the first step toward declaring a climate emergency. 
Floods and heat waves are inflicting devastation at a rate that exceeds our ability to "sustainably grow." 
Policymakers should use the IPCC assessments to develop new policy frameworks or amend existing ones.

Coming to the campaign in India, The significance of 'climate action' was emphasized once again by the organization. 

Disha Ravi, an ardent activist for the campaign, was also surrounded by citizens and activists who shouted out against the government's "illegal and excessive approach in targeting young activists."
She herself was arrested by the delhi police for her actions.

What is worse is that the activists were attacked. 
One to tell them to ‘shut up and stay at home’ and the other involved ‘poisoning their minds with what is taught so that they can’t think freely’. [[5]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/disha-ravi-arrested-for-shouting-out-against-the-government-in-delhi/article31285501.ece)

In July 2020, the Indian government took down the website of the Indian collective of Fridays for Future groups. The groups were spearheading an opposition to the government's disputed amended EIA Draft. [[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Strike_for_Climate#India)
This really brings to the light how the majority of the population is not aware of the climate crisis. Moreover the persons in power are a part of the population too.

Internationally, the campaign is received with varying perceptions. 
Some articles suggest that "the FFF protestors express not only the need for climate action but also call for deeper societal transformation." [[6]]("https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00048/full)
It is believed that the youth poses as an inconvenient barrier between radical and moderate thinking.

"Social movements can generate substantial forces to push for change and demand reforms by putting pressure on existing industries and foster social experiments" - Hess. [[7]]("https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00048/full)

A huge number of young people have rallied for climate action throughout the world, expressing their dissatisfaction with insufficient climate action and a slow response to climate change.
Leftist and right-wing groups have also expressed their views on the issue. Leftist government entites have expressed their support for the movement. They believe that it is an important trigger to a much broader societal and cultural impact. 
Democratization, social justice or anti-capitalism are crucial socio economic issues that are subtly underlined by the movement.

However, the campaign isn't without its ideological divides. The reception, and tha participation, both present a unique mix of various levels of agreement with the ideals, and interpretations. 
THere also exist counter narratives, calling the movement somewhat extremist. There exist many public debates around the matter.

Some believe that FFF is neither radical nor totalitarian. However, there exists schools of thought that question whether the demands of the "children of the apocalypse" should be implemented at all.

The fight is expected to be carried on by the future generation as climate anxiety continues to rise among the youth, which is important to act on.
The campaign's long-term sustainability, according to Sommer, will be increased as it grows, with the "Global Week for Future" climate strikes, which will begin on September 20, signifying the next phase of a "incredible" protest movement. 
Significant labor unions in Germany, for example, will join the school strikes in what will be one of their greatest mobilizations.

Above all, the movement will stay true to Thunberg's motto that "no one is too small to make a difference". This stands true. 
The movement is not novel in any sense. However, the idea of skipping school to partake in the campaign makes it a new one.

Infact the reception received by the campaign isn't possible at all without the previous generations' worth of impact. 
"Every new generation of climate activists has brought their own ideas, strategies, enthusiasm, and new energy to the table, building on and learning from those who came before them."
